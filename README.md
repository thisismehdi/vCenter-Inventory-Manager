# vCenter-Inventory-Manager

# Abstract
The Inventaire vCenter project was developed during a six-month internship to meet the specific needs of managing VMs and clients.

The created web application offers an intuitive interface for centralizing information, automating resource consumption tracking, and simplifying billing processes. This application overcomes the access limitations of vCenter, facilitating the management and billing of resources consumed by clients. The user-friendly interface makes information accessible to all relevant employees without compromising data security.

Using modern technologies such as Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL, the application integrates seamlessly with existing systems like Azure AD and VMware vSphere.
